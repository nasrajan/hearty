								<h3>Paintings and Drawings</h3>
							</header>
							<p>When we look around, we would see the art works of some of the best artists. It could be crayon drawings by a child, casual scribbles on a napkin,
                                                        pencil drawings on the back of a meeting planner, all deserve a place to be showcased, close to heart. At Hearty Arts, we give everybody a place to showcase
                                                        and sell their drawings</p>

								<h3>Lens Captures</h3>
							</header>
							<p>Look around, there is beauty everywhere. Place a lens, close a shutter, the beauty is captured. Technology has advanced so much that
                                                            the medium doesn't matter. Hearty arts showcase some of the best photographic talents, whether they are cell phone clicks or cameras.
